# Client-Server-Development-Web-app-Dashboard

This repository contains my final dashboard project for CS-340, including the dashboard code and the README file documenting the project.

## **How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Writing maintainable and readable programs involves using clear naming conventions, separating code into logical modules, and including comments to explain functionality. For this project, the CRUD Python module from Project One was used to connect the dashboard widgets to the MongoDB database. This modular approach made the code easier to maintain and extend, as all database operations were encapsulated in a single class. In the future, this CRUD module could be reused to build other dashboards or applications that require animal data access without rewriting the database logic.

## **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

When approaching the dashboard project, I first analyzed the client requirements from Grazioso Salvare and broke them into smaller tasks: connecting to the database, filtering records, and visualizing data. I designed the dashboard with clear separation of model, view, and controller components using MongoDB and Dash. Compared to previous assignments, this project required integrating backend and frontend development, which highlighted the importance of data consistency and user interactivity. In future database projects, I would use a similar structured approach—defining database schemas, CRUD operations, and interactive UI components—to meet client needs efficiently.

## **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists design, implement, and maintain software systems that solve real-world problems. In this project, creating a dynamic dashboard allows Grazioso Salvare to visualize and analyze animal shelter data efficiently. This work enables faster decision-making, better resource allocation, and improved operational insights for the organization. By combining database management and interactive visualization, computer scientists can transform raw data into actionable knowledge that supports business objectives.
